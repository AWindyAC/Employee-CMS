# Employee-CMS
Database for keeping track of employees.

I have used Node.js and SQL to create an inline command based application for creating an employee database, and updating that database.

# How to Use
1) Clone the repository or download it as a zip file from GitHub: https://github.com
2) Open your terminal/command prompt in that directory where you downloaded this project using `cd`
3) Install all dependencies by running command `npm install`. This will create node_modules folder with
all required packages installed inside it.
4) Start the app by typing `npm start`, which should bring up a list of prompts.
5) Select one of the choices available to interact with the database.
6) Follow instructions on screen to add new employee details into database OR view existing records.

# Tools
Node.js, SQL, and Inquirer

# Issues

Current Status: when running npm start, prompts appear, but a new command line is initiated (essentially exiting the app).
This works for others but not myself, and I'm not sure why.
